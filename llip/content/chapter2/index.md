# Chapter 2 assignment

Ughh... I probably shouldn't do this, cause these small little assignments are 
meant for you to rehearse and practice a few relevtively small problems to kind
of get you introduced to the programming... But fuck it, I'll walk though 'em,
so - if you **really** can't figure 'em out - I'll help ya. If you *can* figure
'em out on your own, please do so aaand maybe read this stuff *after* you've
finished 'em. *(Cause I still want you to read what I'm writing, even though you
don't need it. Pls, I don't want to feel like I'm writing this for no one, 
that'd be undescribably moronic)*

*Make sure that you've done all of the introductory stuff written in the manual,
so you've got PyCharm running and stuff and you're ready to start programming.*

Okay, so let's get into it.
