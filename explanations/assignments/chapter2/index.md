# Chapter 2 assignment

Ughh... I probably shouldn't do this - as these first few small little 
assignments are meant for you to rehearse and practice a few relevtively small 
problems to *kinda* get you introduced to the programming... But, hey, I'll 
walk though 'em. So, *if* you **really** can't figure them out, I'll help you. 
If you *can* figure them out on your own, please do so... aaand maybe read this 
stuff *after* you've finished them. *('Cause I still want you to read what I'm 
writing, even though you don't need it, as I don't want to feel like I'm 
writing this for no one, that'd be moronic!)*

*Make sure that you've done all of the introductory stuff written in the
manual - so you've got PyCharm running and stuff - and you're ready to start 
programming.*

Okay, let's get into it.
